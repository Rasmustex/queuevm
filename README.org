* queuevm
Queue-based virtual machine.
** Get started
*** Dependencies
This project uses CMake as its build system and clang/llvm for compilation.
*** Building the project
Currently, qvm only has one working component, =qvmi= - the qvm interpreter, which can execute a qvm file in debug mode (the path is currently hard-coded into =src/qvmi.c=. You can also turn off debug-mode there). This project is CMake-based, so to build this component, clone and change directory to this project, and do the following:

#+begin_src shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
#+end_src
This will put =qvmi= in =build/src/qvmi=
