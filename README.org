* queuevm
Queue-based virtual machine.
** Get started
*** Dependencies
This project uses CMake as its build system and clang/llvm for compilation.
*** Building the project
Currently, qvm only has one working component, src_shell{qvmi} - the qvm interpreter, which can execute a qvm file in debug mode (the path is currently hard-coded into src_shell{src/qvmi.c}. You can also turn off debug-mode there). This project is CMake-based, so to build this component, clone and change directory to this project, and do the following:

#+begin_src shell
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
#+end_src
This will put src_shell{qvmi} in src_shell{build/src/qvmi}
